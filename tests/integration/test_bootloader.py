"""End-to-end tests for the RTOP-283 bootloader, run inside the test host.

These drive the real thing: a real Docker daemon, a real registry, real image
pulls with real progress streaming, and the bootloader binary that ships. The
runtime under management is usually a stub (see stubruntime/main.go) because
the failure modes are the interesting part and a real runtime cannot be asked
to exit 1 during start-up on demand. One case swaps in the real runtime image
to prove it actually comes up and reports the right policy.

What is deliberately NOT covered here, and is what the SLM-RP4 round is for:
hardware. There is no /dev/spidev6.0 or /dev/gpiochip0 in a container on a
developer machine, so VPP plugin behaviour and genuine SCHED_FIFO latency have
to be validated on a device.

Standard library only -- the test host has python3 and nothing else.
