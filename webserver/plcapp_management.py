    """Apply or remove the persistent-storage settings for this upload.

    Retain settings are owned by the PROJECT, not by the device: the editor
    emits ``retain.conf`` from the project's Persistent Storage screen and the
    upload carries it here, exactly as it carries ``vpp_plugins.conf``. This
    function is the single authoritative gate, with the same two cases:

    * **Upload includes retain.conf** → validate it and copy it to the runtime
      root, where the PLC application reads it at the next program load.

    * **Upload does not include retain.conf** → delete any existing copy from
      the runtime root, so the built-in file store goes back to being switched
      off. This is not tidiness: it is how a target whose VPP owns retention
      turns the built-in store off. Such a VPP declares
      ``hidesNativeScreens: ['persistent-storage']``, the editor emits no
      retain.conf, and the built-in store then declines the role — leaving the
      vendor's driver as the only store on the device.

    Validation happens HERE rather than at first use. A path whose directory
    does not exist, or a flush period outside the bounds the core accepts, would
    otherwise fail on every flush for the life of the program with nothing but a
    log line to show for it. Refusing it once, with a line in the build log the
    user is already watching, is the difference between a mistake they can see
    and one they cannot.

    Note what this function does NOT do: it does not touch retained VALUES. The
    store itself decides at program start whether what it holds belongs to the
    program now running, by comparing the program MD5 it stored alongside the
    bytes. Keeping that decision in the store is what makes baremetal and
    runtime v4 behave identically — baremetal has no webserver to notice an
    upload at all.
