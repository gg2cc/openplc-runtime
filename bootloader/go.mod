// The bootloader keeps its dependencies to the minimum the job actually needs.
// It is the component that recovers a device when the runtime will not start,
// so every dependency is a way for that recovery to fail: the Docker Engine
// API is plain HTTP over a unix socket, JWT is an HMAC over two base64
// segments, and PBKDF2 is twenty lines of RFC 8018 -- all of which net/http
// and crypto/* already cover -- PBKDF2 is crypto/pbkdf2 as of Go 1.24.
//
// The one exception is modernc.org/sqlite. Authenticating a caller while the
// runtime is DOWN means reading the runtime's own users table, and cold
// recovery after a reboot is exactly when there is no runtime to ask. A
// second credential store in the bootloader would have avoided the dependency at
// the cost of another thing that can be forgotten when an account is revoked,
// which is the worse trade. Pure Go, so it still cross-compiles with CGO off
// and still runs on scratch.
