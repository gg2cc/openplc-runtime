# plc_main is running, whether a program is loaded, and whether that program
# is in ERROR are the webserver's own business -- runtimemanager._monitor()
# already restarts plc_main and drops it into safe mode on rapid crashes. If
# this probe cared about PLC state, a user uploading broken logic would make
# the container unhealthy and trigger a runtime recovery, turning a program
# bug into a device outage.
#
# start-period is generous because a cold start compiles nothing but does load
# plugin venvs, and a runtime marked unhealthy before it has finished booting
# would be restarted for no reason.
